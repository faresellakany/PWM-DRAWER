This PWM DRAWER project is based in the ATmega32 microcontroller 
and is designed to visualize PWM signals in real-time.
it captures an external PWM input using the input capture unit (ICU) to measure signal paramters such as duty cycle and frequency.
the processed data is then graphically represented on a graphical LCD (GLCD), allowing users to monitor signal behavior visually. additionally, 
the system includes a PWM generator function to output customizable PWM signals for testing or simultion purposes. 
This project is ideal for educational and testing environments where accurate PWM signal analysis and visualization are essential for learning or debugging.
